> ## Exercise 2. Pangenome Classification `.challenge`
> A classification of pangenome is being carried out, for these cases. Please fill-in-the-blank according to the given context and the type of pangenome :  
> 
> a. The species that live in environments with rich microbial communities. This would be an example of ___________ pangenome.  
> 
> b. On species that live in isolated niches with limited access to genetic material exchange. This would be an example of ___________ pangenome.  
> 
> > ## Solution
> >a. Open pangenome.  
> > Because these species have so many different ways of exchanging genetic material so they can continuously extend their set of genes.  
> >
> >b. Closed pangenome.  
> > Because of that, a small number of strains can cover the complete pangenome.
